# Pet Shelter Analysis

In this module, we used Pandas to analyze the adoption rates and demographics of animals at the Austin Animal Center from 2013 to 2018. 
Our exploration included examining the most common areas where animals were found, the distribution of animals within the shelter, and the costs associated with spaying and neutering over the years. 
We also investigated adoption rates across different age brackets and dog breeds.
